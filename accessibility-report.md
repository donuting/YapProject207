**Answer to Q1:**

Principle 1: Equitable Use
- The entire chat system adheres to this principle as a person with or without disabilities can use the program 
- Every user has the same experience with the only differences being the people they chat with and the messages they exchange
- Design is simple and should be appealing to most if not all users
- Could implement ability to customize theme of chat and text resizing to support users with visual limitations

Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
- Current program only support sending text messages, however in the future, to accommodate a wider range of 
  preferences, we could implement other ways of communicating through the chat system such as voice messages, photos, 
  videos, and files
- Otherwise, the program is flexible to all users

Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
- Every button is labelled with its exact purpose using minimized word count and labels are shown beside every 
  required input such as in the signup, login, and add friend view
- We could implement a help feature with guides on certain actions (like how to add a friend), or even tips when a 
  new user signs up and logs into their account for the first time 

Principle 4: Perceptible Information
- Labels and buttons throughout entire program describe their use and purpose
- Messages in chat are displayed in order from oldest to newest by time
- Could implement more pictorial representations in system such as for the “send button”

Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
- Delete message allows user to remove an unwanted yet already sent message, however user must get lucky that 
  receiver(s) has not already seen message
- Can also implement edit message for cases where user wants to fix small typos instead of rewriting same corrected long message

Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
- Full access of program requires keyboard typing and some control of the cursor, either by mouse or touchpad
- This principle does not apply to our program as no real physical force is needed, just some coordination and typing skills

Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
- Display of program can be adjusted according to computer screen in use
- Otherwise, this principle does not apply to our program as user’s body size, posture, or mobility is irrelevant 
  for the use of our program so long as they are able to reach a keyboard and mouse


**Answer to Q2:**

Although our program would prove to be useful to anyone as online communication is necessary for everyone these days, 
we would probably market our chat system more towards seniors. The reason it would be less appealing for youth and 
adults is because our chat system does not have any advanced features that some teenagers and adults might want and 
need to use such as sending images, GIFs, and files. Further, our program is extremely easy to use, making sure those 
who are not great with technology can still use the program as intended.

Another group of people we would consider marketing our program towards would be small businesses. The reason for this
group is that there may be certain people out there being either paranoid or worried that the information that they 
are sending to others through large messaging apps is being tracked or leaked. Thus, with a lower based and less known 
chat system, we can ensure these customers the security of their messages and reduce the worry of data leakage.


**Answer to Q3:**

Our program may be less likely used by many demographics. For example, due to the fact that our system contains buttons
and labels in English and there is no option to switch the program’s language, it limits the ability to set up and 
navigate through an account in our system. Although one may send messages in any language they wish to, one must first 
understand what the program requires when signing up or adding a friend or navigating to the menu. Another demographic 
that may not be likely to use this program are people with lower income. Using this program requires not only a device
capable of running it, but also an internet connection thus relating to Anderson’s discussion of unequal access to essentials.
