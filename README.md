A new messaging app developed with the latest technologies.
Allows any user to message other people across the internet, and connect with
friends and family.
Simple, fast, and easy to use.

User Story:
1. Bob accidentally sent out an unfinished message, and wants to quickly modify it before his recipient sees it. (Brady’s story)

2. Bob is bad with words at times and cannot express his reaction with words. Instead, he adds a reaction, in the form of an emoji, to the text he receives.
   (Daniel’s Story)

3. Peter wants to save his friend's birthday in the self chat. He uses the "save birthday" feature and enters in a date and ID to do so.
