friends and family.
Simple, fast, and easy to use.

User Story:
1. Bob accidentally sent a message to the wrong person. He deletes the message before they see it. (Brady’s story)

2. Bob is bad with words at times and cannot express his reaction with words. Instead, he adds a reaction, in the form of an emoji, to the text he receives.
   (Daniel’s Story)

3. Peter wants to save his friends birthday, he goes to the self chat and uses the save birthday feature, only entering in a date and maybe ID to save it.
